      <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is Aqilah, a Japanese Literature student at Universitas Padjadjaran
        with a deep passion for visual art and illustration. While I study language,
        culture, and literature academically, my heart truly belongs to the world of drawing
        and creative expression.</p>
        <p>I specialize in both traditional and digital illustration, often inspired by the stories,
        aesthetics, and symbolism I explore through my studies. I love combining narrative
        elements with visual storytelling to create art that speaks and connects.</p>
        <p>My goal is to grow as an artist, collaborate with other creatives, and eventually build a
        career in the visual arts industry—whether as an illustrator, concept artist, or visual
        storyteller.</p>
        <p>When I’m not working on my university projects, you’ll usually find me sketching, learning
        new techniques, or sharing my latest artwork online.
